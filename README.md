The Thinker: Problem Solver, Innovator, AI & Backend Engineer
--------------------------

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence (B.Tech in AI) from SRM Institute of Science and Technology. Since 2017, I have been passionate about coding, problem solving, and even building robots, which fueled my interest in higher-level reasoning challenges. My expertise spans AI/ML algorithms, Generative AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Prompt Engineering, which I find fascinating and transformative.

I have professional experience leading AI teams and developing AI-powered websites and applications, designing robust backend systems primarily using Flask and managing databases with MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Vector DBs. I am also proficient in front-end technologies like React, and have solid skills in cloud and DevOps using AWS services such as Lambda, EC2, S3, and Docker.

üîç I aspire to innovate and invent new technologies, bridging the gap between AI and practical applications. <br> <br>
