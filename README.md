I am pursuing Bachelor's of technology in Artificial Intelligence. I am a problem solver and AI enthusiast. I've been coding and building robots for 6 years. I've excelled in problems requiring higher level reasoning and problem solving. I've used a lot of AI/ML algorithms and am constantly working on new ones. I have also completed Prompt Engineering which I find fascinating and game changing.
